## What is BanBucket?

BanBucket is an opensource Banano faucet which gives away free Banano (a fork of the cryptocurrency Nano)

This repo contains the client code that communicates with the [backend](https://github.com/kevinli23/banbucket-backend) which handles the application logic and memory management.

## What are Nano and Banano?

Banano (which is forked off of Nano) is a DAG cryptocurrency which enables it to be fast (it takes seconds to transfer) and feeless.

Being fast and feeless is not only a great green alternative to other cryptocurrencies, it also makes for a great way to tip!
